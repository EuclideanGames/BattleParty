# Battle Party

Battle Party is a mobile multiplayer board game, created using the Unity game engine.

#### Quick gameplay
> Battle Party is designed to be played in short bursts, allowing you to take your turn in-game and step away while waiting for the other players to take theirs.
#### Fun minigames
> During their turn, the player will have the opportunity to complete minigames to alter the state of the game, either boosting themselves or harming their opponents.
#### Player-versus-player combat
> Players will be able to attack other players in a variety of ways, and defeating an opponent will grant you certain benefits depending on the game. Worry not, being defeated in battle does not mean the game is over for you.
#### Tournaments
> Participate in daily tournaments to win various in-game prizes depending on how well you do.
#### Collectible gear
> The player will be able to collect gear that affects their in-game stats, such as attack, defense, and movement. Gear can evolve as a game progresses, by fulfilling certain requirements, such as defeating a certain number of enemies or moving some amount of tiles.
